# Task 1: Document Loading and Processing

## Document Files Used
The following three files were used to build the conversational AI system:
1. **`education.txt`**:
   - Contains information about Aymen's educational background, such as degrees and institutions.
2. **`beliefs.txt`**:
   - Includes Aymen's core beliefs and perspectives, particularly regarding technology and society.
3. **`academics.txt`**:
   - Provides details about Aymen's academic achievements, projects, and research.

These files were loaded using `TextLoader` from LangChain, split into smaller chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, and indexed in a Chroma vector store for retrieval.

To further enhance the capabilities of the AI system, other text-generation models or OpenAI models can be explored. Below are some options:

### 1. **OpenAI Models**
   - **`gpt-3.5-turbo`**:
     - A powerful and cost-effective model for generating high-quality, context-aware responses.
     - Can be integrated using the `OpenAI` class in LangChain.
     - Example:
       ```python
       from langchain.llms import OpenAI
       llm = OpenAI(model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0.7)
       ```
   - **`gpt-4`**:
     - The latest and most advanced OpenAI model, offering improved reasoning and understanding capabilities.
     - Suitable for complex queries and generating highly accurate responses.

### 2. **Hugging Face Models**
   - **`flan-t5-xxl`**:
     - A large-scale text-to-text generation model fine-tuned on instruction-based datasets.
     - Provides better performance for tasks requiring detailed and structured answers.
   - **`Llama-2`**:
     - A state-of-the-art open-source language model by Meta.
     - Can be fine-tuned for domain-specific tasks like answering questions about Aymen.

### 3. **Custom Fine-Tuning**
   - Fine-tune existing models (e.g., `fastchat-t5-3b-v1.0` or `flan-t5-xxl`) on domain-specific data (e.g., Aymen's background) to improve accuracy and relevance.

### 4. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Combine multiple models for retrieval and generation:
     - Use a retriever model like `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2` for better document retrieval.
     - Use a generator model like `gpt-3.5-turbo` or `flan-t5-xxl` for high-quality answer generation.

### Benefits of Using Advanced Models:
- **Improved Accuracy**: Advanced models like `gpt-3.5-turbo` and `flan-t5-xxl` provide more accurate and context-aware responses.
- **Better Handling of Complex Queries**: These models can handle multi-turn conversations and complex questions more effectively.
- **Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tuning on domain-specific data ensures the model generates highly relevant answers.
  
# Task 2: Analysis and Problem Solving

## 1) Retriever and Generator Models Utilized

### Retriever Model:
- **Embedding Model**: `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
  - This model generates embeddings for documents and queries, enabling semantic search.
- **Retriever**: Chroma Vector Store
  - Built on top of the Chroma vector store, it retrieves the most relevant document chunks based on embeddings.

### Generator Model:
- **Language Model**: `lmsys/fastchat-t5-3b-v1.0`
  - A text-to-text generation model used to generate answers based on retrieved documents and user queries.

## 2) Analysis of Issues Related to Unrelated Information

### Retriever Model:
#### Potential Issues:
1. **Irrelevant Document Retrieval**:
   - The retriever might fetch unrelated documents if:
     - Embeddings do not accurately capture the semantic meaning of the query.
     - Document chunks are too large or contain unrelated information.
2. **Chunk Overlap**:
   - High `chunk_overlap` in `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` can lead to redundant or irrelevant information.

#### Solutions:
1. Use a more advanced embedding model (e.g., `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2`) or fine-tune the current one.
2. Adjust `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap` parameters for better relevance.

### Generator Model:
#### Potential Issues:
1. **Unrelated Answers**:
   - The generator might produce unrelated answers if:
     - Retrieved documents are noisy or irrelevant.
     - The model is not fine-tuned for the specific domain (e.g., Aymen's background).
2. **Overgeneralization**:
   - The model might generate generic or overly broad answers that do not directly address the query.

#### Solutions:
1. Fine-tune the generator model on domain-specific data (e.g., Aymen's background).
2. Use a more advanced language model (e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo` or `flan-t5-xxl`) for better performance.
3. Improve the quality of retrieved documents by refining the retriever.
